                <h1 class="display-1 text-dark">Thoughts</h1>
                <p class="lead text-dark">Science fiction novels and films of the past have been consistent in their portrayal of the end of the world as a robot-controlled doomsday takeover. Whether it is the Terminator or the Transformers series, our society has always regarded AI invasion as a threat, although admittedly an entertaining one, to our existence. There is no better time to acknowledge that we live in a world powered by more technology than ever. We ourselves are the reason this world rapidly changes. As we put more information into the cyberverse, we provide people, businesses, and policymakers with tools that can do great harm. As our society becomes uncontrollably digital, we must control the amount of information we give it. That is the only way to avoid an apocalyptic future where we are so dependent on technology that it overpowers us.</p>
                <p class="lead text-dark">We provide and share so much information to digital spaces that some of it is bound to be incorrect; this has great consequences when this information is amplified. With social media, “computational systems can incentivize or automate media content in ways that result in broader circulation regardless of accuracy or intent.” Recommender systems go to work as they push content to consumers. The media that makes its way to the forefront of users’ home pages is usually the most shocking – stories that have potential to incite emotions and cause polarization. After all, that’s how these platforms get users’ attention. When false, at best, it is unintentional – misinformation perhaps, in the form of hoaxes or parodies. At its worst, it becomes propaganda or just gaslighting. The prevalence of being surrounded by these lies can threaten our own judgment. When we participate in this cycle of information posting, pushing, and re-posting, the content on these programs grows with no limit. Too much of anything creates apathy; we can see this in voting patterns. Reading through initiatives and policy proposals is time-consuming, not to mention the overwhelming nature of research required to make an informed decision. Thus, low voter turnout attributes to apathy and overload. Limiting the amount of information we put out online will reduce the spread of false ideas that destroy grounds for meaningful discourse. When there is less unnecessary noise on these platforms, it is easier to sort and view material with a closer and more critical eye. The amount of content we can digest is limited, so limiting the amount of content we provide works in our favor.</p>
